    <p>Kiss me hard before you go<br>
Sun-kissed, skin so hot<br>
We're driving in your car<br>
I'll take whatever I can get<br>

Oh, oh, oh, summertime sadnes<br>
Got that James Dean daydream look in his eye<br>
I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
And when we kiss, it's like a rolling thunder<br>

Cruising down the coast<br>
Got my hair undone<br>
I've got that summertime sadness<br>
S-s-summer's gone<br>

Oh, oh, oh, summertime sadness<br>
Got that James Dean daydream look in his eye<br>
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like<br>
And when we kiss, it's like a rolling thunder<br></p>

<h1 id="VP">Vampire by Olivia Rogdrigo</h1>
<p>Hate to give the satisfaction, asking how you're doing now<br>
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?<br>
Just what you wanted<br>
Look at you, cool guy, you got it<br>
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes<br>
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise<br>
I loved you truly<br>
Gotta laugh at the stupidity<br>

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes<br>
But you make the worst one look fine<br
I should've known it was strange<br>
You only come out at night<br>
I used to think I was smart<br>
But you made me look so naive<br>
The way you sold me for parts<br>
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br>
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br>
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire<br>

And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news<br>
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too<br>
You're so convincing<br 
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)<br>
Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill<br>
Can't figure out just how you do it, and God knows I never will<br>
Went for me, and not her<br>
'Cause girls your age know better<br>

I've made some real big mistakes<br>
But you make the worst one look fine<br>
I should've known it was strange<br>
You only come out at night<br>
I used to think I was smart<br>
But you've made me look so naive<br>
The way you sold me for parts<br>
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br>
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br>
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire<br>

You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?<br>
You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart<br>
I tried you help you out, now I know that I can't<br>
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand<br>

I've made some real big mistakes<br>
But you make the worst one look fine<br>
I should've known it was strange<br>
You only come out at night<br>
I used to think I was smart<br>
But you made me look so naive<br>
The way you sold me for parts<br>
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh<br>
Bloodsucker, famefucker<br>
Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire<br></p>

<h1 id="TT">Traitor by Olivia Rodrigo</h1>
<p>Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah<br>

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies<br>
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew<br>
That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse<br>
I kept quiet so I could keep you<br>

And ain't it funny<br>
How you ran to her<br>
The second that we called it quits?<br>

And ain't it funny<br>
How you said you were friends?<br>
Now it sure as hell don't look like it<br>

You betrayed me<br>
And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You'd talk to her<br>
When we were together<br>
Loved you at your worst<br>
But that didn't matter<br>

It took you two weeks<br>
To go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat<br>
But you're still a traitor<br>

Now you bring her around<br>
Just to shut me down<br>
Show her off like she's a new trophy<br>

And I know if you were true<br>
There's no damn way that you<br>
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly<br>

Ain't it funny<br>
All the twisted games<br>
All the questions you used to avoid?<br>

Ain't it funny?<br>
Remember I brought her up<br>
And you told me I was paranoid<br>

You betrayed me<br>
And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You'd talk to her<br>
When we were together<br>
Loved you at your worst<br>
But that didn't matter<br>

It took you two weeks<br>
To go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat<br>
But you're still a traitor<br>

God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
Before I went and fell in love with you<br>
(Ah-ah-ah)/<br>
When she's sleeping in the bed we made<br>
Don't you dare forget about the way<br>

You betrayed me<br>
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
You'd talk to her<br>
When we were together<br>
You gave me your word<br>
But that didn't matter<br>

It took you two weeks<br>
To go off and date her<br>
Guess you didn't cheat<br>
But you're still<br>
You're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)<br>
Yeah, you're still a traitor<br>

Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
Before I went and fell in love with you<br></p>
